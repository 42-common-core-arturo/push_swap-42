## Introduction
Push Swap is a project developed for 42 School that involves sorting a stack of integers using two stacks and a set of predefined operations. The goal is to sort the stack with the minimum number of operations, utilizing sorting algorithms and efficient stack manipulation techniques.


## Installation and Usage
To install and compile the Push Swap project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/push_swap.git
   cd push_swap
   ```
2. Compile:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
3. Run program:

   You can run the executable with a list of integers to be sorted. The general syntax is as follows:
   ```sh
   ./push_swap 4 2 -7 1 3
   ```
   This example sorts the integers 4, 2, -7, 1, and 3 using the minimum number of operations.

## Algorithm
The Push Swap project implements a sorting algorithm that efficiently manipulates two stacks (stack A and stack B) using specified operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr). The goal is to achieve a sorted stack using the least number of operations possible.

## Features
* Sorts a stack of integers using two stacks and predefined operations.
